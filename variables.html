from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# Define the variables
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Define the system of equations
equation1 = Eq(2*x + 3*y, 10)
equation2 = Eq(4*x - 2*y, 4)

# Solve the system of equations
solution = solve((equation1, equation2), (x, y))

# Print the solution
print("Solution for x and y:", solution)

<h2> OUTPUT</h2>
<p>
2x + 3y = 10
4x - 2y = 4
